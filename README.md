## Reflection

> Q: What are the key differences between unary, server streaming, and bi-directional streaming RPC (Remote Procedure Call) methods,
> and in what scenarios would each be most suitable?

A: ...

> Q: What are the potential security considerations involved in implementing a gRPC service in Rust,
> particularly regarding authentication, authorization, and data encryption?

A: ...

> Q: What are the potential challenges or issues that may arise when handling bidirectional streaming in Rust gRPC,
> especially in scenarios like chat applications?

A: ...

> Q: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the `tokio_stream::wrappers::ReceiverStream` for streaming responses in Rust gRPC services?

A: ...

> Q: In what ways could the Rust gRPC code be structured to facilitate code reuse and modularity,
> promoting maintainability and extensibility over time?

A: ...

> Q: In the `MyPaymentService` implementation, what additional steps might be necessary to handle more complex payment processing logic?

A: ...

> Q: What impact does the adoption of gRPC as a communication protocol have on the overall architecture and design of distributed systems,
> particularly in terms of interoperability with other technologies and platforms?

A: ...

> Q: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using `HTTP/2`, the underlying protocol for gRPC, compared to `HTTP/1.1` or `HTTP/1.1` with WebSocket for REST APIs?

A: ...

> Q: How does the request-response model of REST APIs contrast with the bidirectional streaming capabilities of gRPC in terms of real-time communication and responsiveness?

A: ...

> Q: What are the implications of the schema-based approach of gRPC, using Protocol Buffers,
> compared to the more flexible, schema-less nature of JSON in REST API payloads?

A: ...
